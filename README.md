Replicating the results of this paper assumes you have access to [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). It also assumes that you know how
to execute R code using RStudio. 

Data for the project can be found by contacting the researchers.

To run the code, the data folder needs to be downloaded and placed in the same directory as the `full_run_script.R` file (main directory of repository). This is such that the data file `data_full.csv` should be in the `./data/data_full.csv` from the script directory.

To get the results for the paper, simply run the `full_run_script.R` from top to bottom.

Each section of the `full_run_script.R` is marked with the related section in the article.

Output from running the script is displayed either in the R terminal or graph pane.
