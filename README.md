# Craving by Design - code repository

Repository for "Pavlovian Sign-Tracking Distorts Repeated Risk-Taking in Humans" by Elise Payzan-LeNestour, Samuel Thelaus, & Bernard Balleine

To run the code, the data folder needs to be downloaded and placed in the same directory as the `full_run_script.R` file (main directory or repository). This is such that the data file `data_full.csv` should be in the `./data/data_full.csv` from the script directory.

To get the results for the paper, simply run the `full_run_script.R` from top to bottom.
